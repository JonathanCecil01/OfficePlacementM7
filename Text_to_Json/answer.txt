INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS, PP.6-7 
 
1. D Scarce resources must exist in a limited 
quantity. Some important scarce resources 
are time, capital, knowledge, and labor. [6,7] 
2. E Economists study how individuals make 
choices and interact with one another, 
particularly in relationship to resources and 
unlimited wants. They also study the 
outcomes of trade and specialization.  [6,6] 
3. E The items in a grocery store arrive there 
through a long supply chain. On average, 
there are over 33,000 items in a grocery 
store. [6,2] 
4. B Economics contains different subject areas, 
but fundamentally focuses on how people 
make decisions and the effects of those 
decisions. [6,6] 
5. B Scarce resources exist only in a limited 
quantity. Human desires are unlimited. This 
tension creates the key economic conflicts of 
human society.  [6,7; 7,0] 
6. E Economics studies how individuals make 
choices and interact with one another, 
particularly in relationship to resources. The 
sociocultural foundations of capitalism are 
not part of economics. [6,6] 
7. A Adam Smith wrote An Inquiry into the 
Wealth of Nations. He is often considered as 
the father of modern economics. [6,1] 
8. B Economics studies how humans make 
decisions. In order to make rational 
decisions, humans must compare benefits to 
opportunity costs, or the cost of what must be 
given up. [7,5] 
9. D The fact that people must weigh options due 
to the scarce and finite nature of time shows 
the concept of trade-offs. [7,1] 
10. A Opportunity costs arise from making 
decisions with limited resources. [7,2] 
11. A Cost-benefit analysis is the method people 
use to make rational decisions. Economists 
assume people act rationally, which 
primarily means in their self-interest. [7,4] 
12. D Individuals are forced to make trade-offs to 
allocate their limited resources. This concept 
is fundamental in economics. [7,1] 
13. B Economics is the fundamental study of how 
individuals make decisions. The basic 
assumptions of economics are rationality, 
scarcity, trade-offs, gains from trade, and 
opportunity cost.  [6,7; 7,2; 7,4; 7,6] 
14. B Gains from trade result from voluntary 
exchange between individuals of different 
abilities. When people specialize, they 
perform the activities they are the best at or 
derive the most enjoyment from.  [7,6] 
15. E Rational people will consider the many costs, 
together with personal beliefs and impact on 
others, in making a decision.  [7,4]

BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF ECONOMICS, PP.7-8 
 
1. B Value judgements subjectively assess the 
merits of a particular outcome. Value 
judgements are associated with normative 
economics.  [8,2] 
2. B Normative economics uses economic analysis 
to make judgments on what should be versus 
what is. Positive economics analyzes 
situations without passing judgment on what 
is desirable.  [8,1-2] 
3. C Economic models do not need to be realistic. 
A simple model clarifies economic concepts as 
an approximation of real life. [7,8] 
4. D Trade allows people within a society to 
specialize, doing more of the things that they 
enjoy and are good at. If the exchange is 
voluntary, the benefits for both parties 
exceed the costs. [7,6] 
5. B Economics assumes that trade provides net 
benefit and people are rational actors faced 
with the probably of scarcity and unlimited 
wants.  [6,7; 7,2; 7,4; 7,6] 
6. B Positive economics focuses on identifying 
cause-and-effect relationships, without any 
value judgment.   [8,1] 
7. E Economics studies how individuals allocate 
scarce resources, including the efficiency of a 
distribution. Efficient outcomes produce the 
least waste; it does not consider equitability. 
[8,4] 
8. B According to gains from trade, trade only 
happens when costs are less than benefits for 
all groups involved in trade. [7,6] 
9. D Pareto efficiency requires that all resources 
be used, regardless of their distribution.  [8,4] 
10. D Normative economic analysis may use facts 
and data, but it must also express an 
opinion, which requires values. [8,2] 
11. E Pareto efficiency simply states that there is 
no way to raise a person’s well-being or 
resource count without reducing someone 
else’s.  [8,4] 
12. C An individual acts rationally if he buys the 
cheapest goods available due to considering 
the costs of a more expensive product greater 
than the benefits of a higher-quality good. 
[7,4] 
13. D A situation is Pareto efficient when all 
resources are used, such that one person 
cannot be made better off without hurting 
someone else. [8,4] 
14. A Economic models are generally simplified 
when compared to the actual function of the 
modern capitalist economy due to the 
reliance on consistently true axioms to build 
the models that are rarely completely correct 
in reality. [7,8] 
15. C Positive economics does not involve value 
judgments but instead relies on economic 
data and models to make predictions. It 
would describe the outcomes of taxation to 
help normative economists evaluate the 
preferred outcome. [8,1]

SECTION I SUMMARY, PP.9 
 
1. C The two primary fields of economics are 
microeconomics and macroeconomics. 
Microeconomics focuses on the interaction 
between supply and demand in specific 
markets while macroeconomics studies 
national economies.  [9,1] 
2. A Positive economics is value-free, meaning 
that it involves the judging of objective 
criteria.  Normative economics, on the other 
hand, involves value judgments.   [9,9] 
3. A Normative economics focuses on evaluating 
different economic outcomes and using value 
judgments.  [9,10] 
4. C Cost-benefit analysis is the method people 
use to make rational decisions. Economists 
assume people act rationally, which 
primarily means in their self-interest.  [9,6] 
5. E Gains from trade in economics primarily 
refer to inter-firm and inter-nation economic 
activities, though the very fact that markets 
exist is premised on the assumption that 
trade, at a micro level, is beneficial too.   [9,7] 
6. A Economists assume that when it is 
voluntary, trade is always beneficial to all 
parties involved – a concept known as gains 
from trade. International tariffs thus always 
result in a loss in welfare.   [9,7] 
7. C Scarce resources must exist in a limited 
quantity. Some important scarce resources 
are time, capital, knowledge, and labor.  [9,4] 
8. D Unemployment, national income, monetary 
and fiscal policies are all macroeconomic 
ideas involving the national economy. 
Microeconomists focus on single industries 
and smaller-scale issues.  [9,1] 
9. A Opportunity costs primarily arise from 
making choices with limited resources. The 
opportunity cost of Sky’s studying is the cost 
of what she might have made had she spent 
her time otherwise. e.g. mowing the lawn. [9,5] 
10. B Time, knowledge, capital, labor, and energy 
are all scarce or limited resources even 
though they may not all be physical 
resources.  [9,4] 
11. B Microeconomics and macroeconomics share 
the same basic assumptions, although they 
differ in their use, modes of analysis, scale, 
and subject. Microeconomics focuses on the 
small scale while macroeconomics focuses on 
the large scale.  [9,2] 
12. E Macroeconomics focuses on economics on the 
national level such as CPI, GDP, inflation, 
and trade balances.  [9,1] 
13. E The idea of Pareto efficiency was developed 
by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. It 
describes a situation in which no actor can be 
made more well-off without 
redistribution.  [9,11] 
14. B Economists assume that all resources are 
scarce. They study how humans allocate 
these scarce resources to satisfy their 
unlimited desires.  [9,4] 
15. D The main purpose of economic models is to 
identify important assumptions in economic 
activity.  [9,8] 
 
 
ECON 
FOCUSED QUIZ 04 
MARKET COMPETITION PP.10-13 
 
1. E Perfectly competitive markets have a highly 
standardized product and a large number of 
buyers and sellers that are highly informed 
about price. An individual buyer or seller’s 
decision does not change the market 
price.  [11,0] 
2. C An inferior good is defined as one for which 
there is a higher quantity demanded with a 
lower income, which happens when an 
economy experiences a recession.  [13,9] 
3. A The law of demand expresses an inverse 
relationship between price and quantity 
demanded. Therefore, as price increases, the 
quantity demanded decreases.  [12,1] 
4. E A highly organized market consists of buyers 
and sellers meeting in one place and 
auctioneers to set the price. Examples 
include stock exchanges and auctions. A 
farmer’s market is not highly organized since 
each seller sets their own price.   [10,6] 
5. E A demand curve is always downward sloping, 
due to the negative relationship between 
price and quantity demanded, as stated in 
the law of demand.  [12,1] 
6. D A normal good is defined as one for which 
there is a higher quantity demanded with 
higher income.  [13,8] 
7. D Microeconomics focuses on the interactions 
between supply and demand in specific 
markets. These interactions determine the 
price and quantity supplied within the 
market.  [10,2] 
8. D The definition of a market is that it consists 
of all the buyers and sellers of the particular 
good or service but excludes buyers and 
sellers of other unrelated goods and 
services.   [10,5] 
9. A Changes to a good’s price do not cause the 
demand curve to shift; rather, it changes 
along the same demand curve and results in 
a change in quantity demanded.  [13,6] 
10. E Changes to market price do not shift the 
demand or supply curves but rather result in 
shifts along the curve.   [13,6] 
11. E Although few, perfectly competitive markets 
are useful in economics because they serve as 
a benchmark for other types of markets and 
provide insights applicable to other markets 
as well.  [12,0] 
12. E A highly competitive market does not have to 
be formal, unlike a highly organized market. 
It experiences little change to market price 
as a result of changes to the number of 
market participants or the price change of an 
individual seller.  [10,7] 
13. C The demand curve is a simplified graph with 
quantity demanded on the x-axis and price 
on the y-axis. It can be overlaid against the 
supply curve to find the point of market 
equilibrium.  [13,3] 
14. D A demand curve is always downward sloping, 
due to the negative relationship between 
price and quantity demanded, as stated in 
the law of demand.  [12,1] 
15. E Currency is a highly competitive homogenous 
good, with prices that are updated frequently 
and easily accessible to the buyers, many 
buyers and sellers, and a highly standardized 
product.  [10,7]

FOCUSED QUIZ 05 
DEMAND AND SUPPLY, PP.13-15 
 
1. D The market supply curve represents the total 
supply in a market. It is arrived at by adding 
the individual supply curves 
horizontally.  [15,2] 
2. B Preference, or taste, may affect a market 
demand curve, but a change in preferences 
does not affect supply. Supply responds 
directly or indirectly to pricing – for example, 
the cost of raw materials.  [15,3] 
3. B The supply curve can be shifted by a 
multitude of factors, including expectations, 
technology, input prices, and the number of 
sellers.  [15,4-7] 
4. A The law of supply states that there is a 
positive relationship between price and 
quantity supplied; therefore, a supply curve 
should slope upward.  [14,4] 
5. A On supply and demand curves, price is the 
independent variable. All other variables are 
held equal, or ceteris paribus, such that there 
is only one independent variable.  [15,10] 
6. A The law of supply states that as price 
increases, producers supply more. The law of 
demand states that as price increases, 
consumers demand less.  [14,4] 
7. C When the price of a good increases, the 
quantity demanded of the substitute good 
increases since consumers switch to a 
cheaper option.  [13,10] 
8. D Producers will supply as long as they are 
earning an economic profit or until their 
opportunity cost exceeds their earnings.  [13,0] 
9. B Producers will supply as long as they receive 
more than their opportunity cost. When 
producers receive a high price, they will 
attempt to maximize their profits in that 
market.  [15,0] 
10. B When price increases, supply also increases. 
This relationship is positive: when one 
increases, so does the other.  [14,4] 
11. A The amount of a good supplied is the amount 
sellers can and will supply. This amount may 
maximize producer profits, but it could also 
result in losses.  [14,4] 
12. B When the price of a good decreases, the 
quantity demanded of the complement good 
increases and vice versa.  [14,0] 
13. B The quantity of a good produced is shown on 
the horizontal axis of a supply curve. This 
quantity differs from the amount of good sold 
because goods may be produced but not 
sold.  [15,1] 
14. D A supply curve shows the relationship 
between price and quantity supplied. 
Quantity supplied is on the horizontal axis 
while price is on the vertical axis.  [14,4] 
15. D Market demand is calculated by adding all of 
the individual buyer’s demand together, or in 
other words, adding individual demand 
curves horizontally.  [15,2]

FOCUSED QUIZ 06 
SUPPLY AND EQUILIBRIUM, PP.15-20 
 
1. E The market equilibrium describes the 
prevailing market price and the quantity 
sold. Total surplus is maximized, imparting 
maximum benefits. Buyers and sellers are 
satisfied, and Pareto efficiency is 
achieved.  [20,8] 
2. B In the worlds of science and social sciences, 
equilibrium is the state of all forces being 
balanced within a system. In economics, 
equilibrium specifically indicates when no 
individual has any motive to alter his or her 
behavior.  [15,9] 
3. B As price increases, producers will supply 
more and consumers will demand less. When 
price is higher than equilibrium, there will 
be an excess of supply because consumers do 
not want as much of the good as producers 
are selling.  [18,1] 
4. E When a market is in equilibrium, the price of 
the good indicates the value that consumers 
place on the good to consumers.   [20,1] 
5. A Tastes can influence shifts in the supply 
curve, such as the environmental example in 
this question. [15,6] 
6. C When more sellers enter the market, supply 
increases because there are more suppliers of 
the good.  [15,7] 
7. E A tax is not a cost of production and 
therefore is not an input. However, fixed 
costs that do not change based on how much 
of a good is produced, such as rent, or raw 
materials, such as leather, are part of the 
input price.  [15,4] 
8. D At competitive market equilibrium, the 
overall benefit is maximized as it guarantees 
that the product goes to the consumers who 
value it the most at the lowest costs of 
supply. This does not guarantee, however, 
that everyone will be allocated 
resources.  [20,8] 
9. E If the price is higher than the consumer is 
willing to pay, the consumer will not 
purchase the ticket. As a result, they will 
have no consumer surplus.  [20,5] 
10. E Price functions as the primary conveyor of 
information in a perfectly competitive 
market: it signals how much consumers are 
willing to pay and how much suppliers are 
willing to sell for.   [20,1] 
11. C Equilibrium occurs at the place where supply 
and demand curves intersect. At equilibrium, 
the quantity demanded and supplied are 
equal.  [15,10] 
12. B If input prices fall, sellers will produce more. 
Input prices are not directly related to price, 
so no effect on price can be assumed from the 
information that input prices decrease.  [15,4] 
13. B Suppliers try to maximize their profit. If 
suppliers expect prices to increase in the 
future, they are likely to withhold product so 
they can earn more money on it.  [15,6] 
14. A Only one point of intersection exists between 
supply and demand curves. Because the 
supply curve slopes upward and the demand 
curve slopes downward, they can only have 
on point of intersection.  [15,8] 
15. D Changes in price result in movement along 
the supply curve, not a shift of the curve 
itself. The same holds true for demand.   [15,4-
7] 
 
 
ECON 
FOCUSED QUIZ 07 
SURPLUS AND EQUILIBRIUM, PP.18-20 
 
1. C The height of the supply curve numerically 
indicates the price producers will sell for; 
this number can be interpreted as producers’ 
willingness to sell the product.   [20,1] 
2. D Excess demand exists when price is lower 
than market price because consumers 
demand more than producers supply, which 
will then drive prices up to equilibrium.   [18,3-
4] 
3. B Competitive markets distribute scarce 
resources to consumers who value these 
goods the most, in the process maximizing 
benefits from the exchange and moving the 
market towards equilibrium. A competitive 
market has minimal government 
intervention.  [20,1] 
4. E The producer surplus measures the 
difference between market price and 
opportunity cost for the different suppliers. 
In this case, 10+20+30+40 = $100.  [20,7] 
5. A When total surplus is maximized the market 
must be Pareto efficient because social 
welfare is maximized.   [20,8] 
6. B As price increases, producers will supply 
more and consumers will demand less. When 
price is higher than equilibrium, there will 
be an excess of supply because consumers do 
not want as much of the good as producers 
are selling.  [18,1-2] 
7. C Consumer surplus lies below the demand 
curve and above equilibrium. Producer 
surplus is the triangle located below the 
equilibrium price and above the supply 
curve.  [20,6] 
8. A The height of the demand curve is equivalent 
to price and thus consumers’ willingness to 
pay. The height of the demand curve at a 
single point represents the marginal buyer’s 
willingness to pay.  [20,1] 
9. A Producer surplus is the triangle located 
below the equilibrium price and above the 
supply curve. Consumer surplus lies below 
the demand curve and above 
equilibrium.   [20,7] 
10. B Producer surplus exists when producers sell 
the good for more than the minimum price 
they would have sold for. This minimum 
price can be interpreted as equivalent to 
their opportunity cost; thus, surplus exists 
when market price is greater than 
opportunity cost.  [20,7] 
11. A A marginal seller is a person indifferent to 
selling or not selling the good at a given 
price. Their willingness to sell is represented 
by the height of the supply curve at a single 
point.  [20,7] 
12. E Social planners should attempt to maximize 
social welfare. According to laws of 
rationality, consumers and producers should 
obey their own self-interests.  [20,8] 
13. B Competitive markets will tend to maximize 
social welfare and stabilize at equilibrium. 
Market inefficiencies will lead to inefficient 
outcomes.  [20,1] 
14. D Consumer surplus lies below the demand 
curve and above equilibrium price, the 
difference between what they would have 
and actually spent on the good.   [20,6] 
15. B Competitive markets usually shift toward 
equilibrium. There, people who want the 
good the most will pay the most and thus 
purchase the good.  [20,2]

CHANGES IN MARKET EQUILIBRIUM, PP.23-25 
 
1. A Market curves shift and alter equilibrium 
price and quantity. When only demand 
increases while supply is unchanged, 
equilibrium price and quantity increase.  [25,1] 
2. A Bovine Growth Hormone is an example of a 
technological advancement that shifted the 
supply curve for milk rightwards. It allowed 
farmers to produce 10-15% more milk with 
little additional costs.  [23,0] 
3. A An increase in the supply curve causes 
consumer surplus to increase because price 
decreases thus providing more surplus to 
consumers of the product.  [23,1-2] 
4. A While new technologies have direct effects on 
the supply curves for a good, they also have 
indirect effects termed externalities.  [23,0] 
5. B The lower input prices cause the supply of 
gasoline to increase which shifts the 
equilibrium point down and to the right.  [25,1] 
6. D Bovine Growth Hormone is an example of a 
technological advancement that shifted the 
supply curve for milk rightwards. It allowed 
farmers to produce 10-15% more milk with 
little additional costs. Farmers must “buy in” 
to this new technology to remain competitive 
as the market adjusts to this higher level of 
production. [23,0] 
7. E Changes in market equilibrium do not 
produce wholly predictable effects. When 
demand increases and supply does not 
change, the effect on consumer surplus 
cannot be determined in advance.   [25,1] 
8. E Some public campaigns aim to discourage 
activities detrimental to individual or social 
welfare. Demand falls if such campaigns are 
effective.  [25,0-1 ] 
9. E A rightward shift in the demand curve will 
result in an increase in producer surplus. 
The effect on consumer surplus is 
ambiguous.  [25,1 ] 
10. D Cigarette smoking can have harmful 
consequences. As a result, policymakers have 
placed warning labels on cigarettes to 
attempt to reduce demand.  [25,0] 
11. B A rightward shift in the demand curve will 
result in an unambiguous increase in total 
surplus, making society better off.  [25,1] 
12. D A decrease in demand for a product reduces 
the market price for that product as fewer 
consumers are willing to purchase at any 
price.  [25,1] 
13. A While Bovine Growth Hormone does increase 
production at low costs, it could harm 
producers who will be forced to sell at lower 
prices. The same result occurs with the 
introduction of technology in any 
market.  [23,0] 
14. D The drop in the price of beef causes the 
demand curve of pork to shift to the left. This 
will cause the equilibrium point to shift down 
and to the left.  [25,1] 
15. D Shifts of both curves create ambiguous 
effects as they create opposing forces. 
However, both an increase in supply and a 
decrease in demand lower the equilibrium 
price.   [25,1]

FOCUSED QUIZ 09 
PRICE ELASTICITY, PP. 25-26 
 
1. B When price increases, demand will decrease; 
when price decreases, demand will increase. 
This negative correlation results in price 
elasticity of demand always being 
negative.  [25,4] 
2. E Consumers’ responsiveness to price change is 
measured by price elasticity of demand. A 
higher elasticity indicate consumers are 
more responsive.  [25,3] 
3. A Demand is inelastic when a 1% change in 
price results in a less than 1% change in 
demand. The more vertical a demand curve, 
the more inelastic it is.  [25,5] 
4. B The elasticity of supply will be inelastic if the 
inputs needed to produce the good are 
scarce.  [26,6] 
5. E The expression (Q∆P)/(P∆Q) represents the 
elasticity of demand or supply (QD or 
QS).   [26,3] 
6. A In many cases, insulin is necessary for 
survival. Necessities have low elasticity 
because consumers need them regardless of 
price.  [25,9] 
7. D Sandwiches have a high elasticity of demand 
because there are many sellers with similar 
products in the market. The other examples 
are scarce or have high barriers to entry to 
purchase (cost, etc.) [25,8] 
8. E Price elasticity of supply measures how 
easily suppliers can change the amount they 
produce. Markets with low barriers of entry 
and exit will be more elastic.  [26,4] 
9. D Many factors can affect the price elasticity of 
demand, including the number of substitutes 
a good has, the time horizon under 
consideration, the necessity of its purchase, 
and the scope of its definition.  [25,8-11] 
10. A Supply is less elastic over the short term 
than the long term. Suppliers must acquire 
the inputs necessary to increase their 
production or get rid of unnecessary inputs 
when decreasing production, which can only 
happen over the long term.   [26,7] 
11. C The supply of Picasso paintings is perfectly 
inelastic because producers can never change 
the amount they supply.  [26,8] 
12. E When the price of a good doubles, the 
quantity demanded is cut in half. Therefore, 
the price elasticity of demand is -1, so the 
good is unit elastic.  [25,5] 
13. A Products like Coke have very elastic demand 
because they have close substitutes. Soft 
drinks have much more inelastic demand 
because the good is defined broadly, 
restricting the number of possible 
substitutes.   [26,8] 
14. B The closer a curve's slope is to 0, the more 
elastic it will be. The curve with the highest 
slope number would be the least elastic.  [25,5] 
15. C Elasticity of supply is measured by dividing 
percent change in supply by percent change 
in price. If price changes 25% and supply 
changes 50%, the elasticity is 2.  [25,3]

PRICE CONTROLS AND TAXES, PP.29-36 
 
1. E Rent ceilings, and price ceilings generally, 
are imposed below market equilibrium, and 
consequently cause quantity supplied to 
decrease.   [32, Figure 16] 
2. B The minimum wage is a form of price control, 
as it sets a minimum price for labor. Housing 
often has a price ceiling to help the poor find 
places to live.   [29,5] 
3. C Price floors appear above equilibrium 
because they restrict price from decreasing. 
They do not appear below equilibrium.  [32,2] 
4. B Tax revenue is larger the more inelastic the 
supply or demand is. A perfectly inelastic 
supply curve would have the most tax 
revenue.   [34,1] 
5. D Deadweight loss is a consequence of a tax. A 
tax leads to a reduction in social welfare as 
the consumers and producers have to take on 
a burden when a good is bought or sold with 
a tax.  [33,8] 
6. B Taxes have two effects on society. 
Deadweight loss represents the decrease in 
social welfare as a result of the tax, and some 
of the revenue is transferred to the 
government as a result of the tax.  [38,8-9] 
7. B Deadweight loss is minimized when supply 
and demand are more inelastic. The market 
with the most inelastic supply and demand 
will have the smallest deadweight loss.  [34,1] 
8. B Price controls always result in deadweight 
loss, a category of social costs, since they 
restrict the actions of the free market.   [29,6] 
9. A Price ceilings limit prices in a market where 
quantity demanded exceeds quantity 
supplied. If apartment prices are too high, 
rent ceilings will be installed to protect 
consumers.  [29,7] 
10. A Rent controls decrease the profit suppliers 
earn from their product and therefore 
suppliers’ incentive to provide the product. 
Rent controls therefore may lead to lower 
quality housing because landlords have no 
incentive to maintain their products.  [32,1] 
11. E If a $1 tax is placed on suppliers, the supply 
curve will shift leftwards by $1. This reflects 
the fact that suppliers will need an extra 
dollar in compensation to produce at the 
previous level.   [33,5] 
12. E The more elastic the market, the greater the 
deadweight loss caused by a tax. As jam has 
many close substitutes, it will have a high 
elasticity of supply and of demand.  [34,1] 
13. B Elasticity has the largest effect on who bears 
the burden of a tax. Between buyers and 
sellers, the more inelastic will bear the 
burden of the tax.  [36,1] 
14. E Rent ceilings, and price ceilings generally, 
are imposed below market equilibrium price. 
This allows renters to discriminate against 
tenants and prevents the efficient allocation 
of apartments.   [29,8] 
15. B In 1979, oil prices rose dramatically as a 
result of oil supply issues in the Middle East. 
Price ceilings were instituted to protect 
American consumers.  [29,5]

PRODUCTION POSSIBILITY FRONTIERS, PP. 35-40 
 
1. B Free trade causes nations or individuals to 
specialize in what they produce most 
efficiently. This increases the sum total of 
goods, benefiting both parties.  [36,8] 
2. D The slope of a PPF curve is how much of the 
good on the y-axis a producer must give up in 
order to increase output of the good on the x-
axis by one unit.  [35,1-2] 
3. D Every point on a PPF curve is efficient and 
maximizes the producer’s capacity. He or she 
produces at whatever point on the curve he 
or she prefers. Points above the curve are 
unattainable and points below the curve are 
inefficient.   [36,2] 
4. C A PPF graph shows all of the different 
combinations of goods a single entity can 
produce at maximum capacity, so it assumes 
the economy is isolated and has no 
trade.  [35,1-2] 
5. B The two intercepts of a PPF curve indicate 
how much of either good an agent can 
produce if exclusively producing that 
good.  [36,0] 
6. E The two intercepts of a PPF curve indicate 
how much of either good a party can produce 
if they exclusively specialized in that 
good.  [36,0] 
7. A Importing lowers price, and thus increases 
domestic supply and domestic consumer 
demand. Domestic producers do not benefit, 
assuming the domestic price is higher than 
the world price.    [40,5] 
8. D Comparative advantage is the relative 
efficiency a person or group has in producing 
a good. With comparative advantage, a 
producer can produce the same good with 
less opportunity cost than another producer, 
ceteris paribus.   [36,6] 
9. B Every point of a PPF curve is the maximum 
that an agent can produce in a given amount 
of time.  [36,1] 
10. B Exporting increases the price of a good and 
thus increases domestic producer supply and 
decreases domestic consumer demand. Social 
welfare and producer surplus increase; 
consumer surplus decreases.  [40,4] 
11. A The lower world price becomes the domestic 
price and less domestic producers are willing 
to produce at the lower price.  [40,4] 
12. E While free trade invariably increases total 
surplus, it can harm either producers or 
surplus depending on the world price of the 
good. These parties can lobby against free 
trade agreements.  [40,1] 
13. A The slope of a PPF curve is how much less of 
the good on the y-axis an agent can produce 
in order to increase output of the good on the 
x-axis by one unit. Straight lines have 
constant slope.  [36,1] 
14. C If a PPF curve is not a straight line, then 
change in y in relation to change in x differs 
across the graph, and, hence, the opportunity 
cost of producing one good at the expense of 
another changes.  [36,1] 
15. D A production possibilities frontier (PPF) 
depicts trade-offs involved in producing two 
goods and indicates all efficient combinations 
that can be produced. A firm for which the 
PPF is above and to the right of another’s can 
produce a greater quantity of both goods and 
has an absolute advantage.      [36,3]

PROFIT MOTIVE; FIRMS’ BEHAVIOR, PP.40-43 
 
1. A It is possible for a firm to produce a low 
quantity of goods such that, although 
marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, the 
total revenue does not compensate for fixed 
cost.  [42,6] 
2. E If economic profit is positive in a competitive 
market, firms enter the market and drive the 
price down until economic profit is zero.  [43,2] 
3. B Total revenue is the cost of a good multiplied 
by quantity and is thus linearly proportional 
to quantity.  [40,7] 
4. C Accounting profit is total revenue minus total 
cost. If total cost exceeds total revenue, a 
firm’s accounting profit will be negative.  [40,7] 
5. C In a competitive market, marginal revenue is 
the market equilibrium price of the good. It 
will not change as a firm increases output in 
a competitive market because prices will 
fall.  [42,8] 
6. D Rent does not change in relation to the 
output of a firm, hence rent is a fixed 
cost.  [42,2] 
7. D The cost of labor is variable since firms can 
hire and fire workers. Fixed costs are 
independent of production level.  [42,2] 
8. A A firm is an organization that receives 
money in exchange for goods and services. 
The Federal Reserve, in contrast, is a 
governmental institution that oversees the 
money supply.  [40,6] 
9. E Not all inputs are equally suitable for 
producing a certain good. As quantity 
increases, firms must use more of these less-
suitable inputs, leading to diminishing 
returns to scale.  [42,6] 
10. B Diminishing returns to scale refer to the 
decrease in added production with the 
addition of inputs. With few workers, the 
addition of each worker contributes to 
greater efficiency; each additional worker has 
fewer ways to efficiently increase 
output.      [42,6] 
11. A If economic profits are negative, the firm 
could make more utilizing its resources for 
the alternative. In the long-run, it will leave 
the market and switch to the more profitable 
activity.  [43,2] 
12. D Economic profit is zero in a competitive 
market. A firm’s accounting profit equals its 
opportunity cost.  [43,3] 
13. E Economic costs include opportunity costs of 
the resources used in production, while 
accounting costs include only the actual costs 
of production. Including opportunity costs 
helps a firm know if it is actually maximizing 
its profits based on all of its other 
options.  [40,7] 
14. B Marginal cost increases with output, and 
firms produce at a quantity such that 
marginal revenue equals marginal cost.  [42,9] 
15. D Firms maximize profits by producing at the 
quantity where marginal revenue equals 
marginal cost. This is true regardless of the 
type of market competition.  [42,9]

PERFECT AND IMPERFECT COMPETITION, PP. 42-46 
 
1. E In a market with a high fixed cost, society 
can benefit from one firm serving the entire 
market, and hence lowering average 
cost.  [44,1] 
2. C In monopolistically competitive markets, 
such as the bookshop or candy market, each 
firm produces its own unique goods, hence 
there are no barriers of entry.  [48,7] 
3. B Under perfect price discrimination, the 
suppliers sets prices according to consumers’ 
willingness to pay. For example, with 
financial aid, universities price schooling 
according to what students are willing to 
pay.  [45,8] 
4. A Each seller in a cartel produces only a 
portion of the total supply of a good in a 
market, and, although the marginal cost for 
a single firm providing the entire supply is 
equal to marginal revenue, due to 
diminishing returns to scale, the marginal 
revenue for each member of a cartel is larger 
than marginal cost.  [48,1] 
5. C An oligopoly is a state of limited competition, 
where the market is shared by a small 
number of producers with very high barriers 
to entry.   [47,4] 
6. E For a seller in a cartel, marginal revenue is 
greater than marginal cost, and so a seller 
faces the temptation to increase quantity. 
Doing so violates the cartel’s agreement to 
limit supply.  [48,1] 
7. D In a market with high fixed cost, society can 
benefit from one firm serving the entire 
market (a natural monopoly) hence lowering 
average cost.  [44,1] 
8. B Firms in a perfectly competitive market are 
price takers, and so marginal revenue is 
constant and independent of production, 
hence showing up as a flat line.  [42,6] 
9. C Copyright laws and patents grant an 
individual exclusive right to sell a good. They 
thus facilitate monopolies.  [43,10] 
10. E Firms that face a downward sloping curve 
have market power, as they choose rather 
than take market prices.  [43,7] 
11. D Oligopolies can sometimes limit supply below 
that of a competitive market, but sometimes 
they are not able to, thus producing at 
quantities and prices nearer to competitive 
market levels.  [48,1] 
12. C The three main methods used to handle 
monopolies like utilities provision are 
legislation, regulation, and public ownership. 
All these methods involve preventing 
monopolies from reducing competition in 
markets.  [45,7] 
13. E Firms possess market power if they face a 
downward sloping demand curve. Firms 
generally gain market power by increasing 
their share of the total supply, or by 
significantly differentiating their products 
from competitors’.  [43,7] 
14. B Firms in a competitive market face a 
perfectly elastic, or horizontal demand curve. 
Increasing price above market price will 
cause demand for a specific firm’s goods to 
reach zero, as buyers will simply buy from 
different sellers.  [42,8] 
15. D Barriers to entry can allow a monopoly to 
form in a market. Sole ownership of a key 
resource of a particular would be one such 
barrier.   [43,8]

DEALING WITH MONOPOLIES – MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION, 
PP.45-48 
 
1. D In 1890, the United States federal 
government passed the Sherman Anti-Trust 
Act. The government intended to increase 
market competition with this act, thereby 
reducing the power of monopolies.  [45,6] 
2. C A monopoly using perfect price 
discrimination would make each customer 
pay the exact value they placed on the 
product. Hence, MC = the market demand 
curve.  [45,8] 
3. E Price discrimination increases social welfare 
by making the marginal revenue curve more 
similar to the demand curve. The market 
moves closer to the point where demand and 
MC intersect – the socially efficient 
quantity.  [47,3] 
4. C Public utilities, a natural monopoly, face 
heavy regulations, such as the inability to 
freely establish prices. Local water, sewer, 
and sanitation services, on the other hand, 
fall under public ownership, with municipal 
governments operation.  [45,7] 
5. B Monopolies have the most concentrated 
production as there is only one firm in the 
market. This firm controls all the production 
decisions for that market.  [43,8] 
6. B A monopolistically competitive firm, like a 
monopoly, has an incentive to restrict 
production in order to increase price – this 
being possible as the good is 
differentiated.   [45,5] 
7. B Monopolistically competitive firms’ prices 
exceed their marginal costs. This factor 
creates social inefficiency as consumers value 
products more than one additional unit 
would cost.  [48,8] 
8. D Monopolistically competitive firms’ prices 
exceed their marginal costs. This factor 
creates social inefficiency since consumers 
value products higher than one additional 
unit would cost.  [48,8] 
9. C A market is considered monopolistic 
competition when many suppliers in it 
produce similar but differentiated goods. The 
market for aircrafts is an oligopoly as it is 
controlled by a few select firms.  [48,4] 
10. E Monopolies use price discrimination to 
charge consumers who place different values 
on their product different prices. Price 
discrimination increases monopolies’ 
revenues and decreases deadweight 
loss.  [45,8] 
11. E Monopolistic competition includes any 
market that has a differentiated product, 
allowing many producers to enter and exit 
the market easily.   [48,4] 
12. A When a monopolistically competitive firm is 
earning positive profits, other firms will 
enter the market, supplying similar 
products. As monopolistic competition entails 
zero barriers to entry, firms can easily enter, 
bringing the profits to zero in the long 
run.  [48,7] 
13. E Oligopolies lie somewhere between perfect 
competition and a monopoly, making them a 
form of imperfect competition. Though they 
often result in cartels, oligopolies always 
result in some reduction in social 
welfare.  [48,1] 
14. D A monopolistically competitive firm has a 
downward-sloping demand curve due to its 
differentiated products. This demand curve 
makes the firm’s marginal revenue less than 
its price.  [48,5] 
15. C In a cartel, suppliers cooperate to behave like 
a monopolist and maximize total profits. 
Cartels are illegal in the United States, but 
OPEC is a major international example of 
one.  [48,1]

CREATIVE DESTRUCTION – MARKET FAILURE PP. 48-53 
 
1. C Externalities arise when rival goods are 
consumed by one party in such a way that 
another party is also affected. Since nobody 
owns common resources, one party can 
benefit or be harmed by another party’s use 
of the good.  [55,2] 
2. D A negative externality confers an 
unaccounted disadvantage onto a third party. 
A negative externality can be visualized as a 
leftward shift of the supply curve, 
demonstrating that the quantity allocated by 
the market is too high and the market price 
is too low. Ideally, markets should produce 
less of a negative externality and sell the 
good at a higher price, due to the unintended 
effects of the externality.     [52, Figure 26] 
3. B Governments typically use subsidies and 
taxes to remedy the effects of positive and 
negative externalities, respectively. When 
the effects of an externality cannot be 
measured, a quota, which limits the activity 
producing the externality, becomes more 
effective.   [53,1] 
4. E The Coase Theorem requires clearly defined 
property rights to work. The distribution of 
such rights is immaterial. Negotiation also 
has to be low enough in cost that it does not 
materially affect the benefits of resolving the 
externality.   [51,5] 
5. E Through innovation, firms can establish 
market power. This action of creating a new 
product or service essentially establishes a 
temporary monopoly, allowing a firm to earn 
economic profits.  [49,2] 
6. D Market failures occur when competitive 
markets produce outcomes that are not 
socially desirable. Cases of imperfect 
competition tend to move toward the socially 
desirable point in the market, but when this 
movement does not happen, a market failure 
occurs.  [49,7] 
7. D A graph of a positive externality would use 
an increase in the demand curve to represent 
the marginal social benefits of the 
externality. Every point on the curve would 
shift up by the amount of the increase 
resulting from the externality.  [51,2] 
8. A Consumer and producer surplus must be 
maximized for a market to be socially 
optimal. An activity that generates a 
negative externality cannot have an optimal 
level of zero, as both producers and 
consumers still desire some amount of the 
product.  [50,7] 
9. D Pollution acts as a negative externality 
because it could negatively impact the 
environment. Since the party causing 
pollution does not account for this negative 
effect on the environment, this pollution can 
be considered a negative externality.  [50,4] 
10. C The Coase Theorem states that parties 
involved with an externality should be able 
to resolve the externality through 
negotiations. Ronald Coase came up with 
this theorem.  [51,3] 
11. E Entrepreneurs attempt to create new goods, 
services, production method, or markets. 
Their work helps economies grow and 
develop.  [49,3] 
12. B Scientific innovations can obtain patents. 
Having a patent transforms these 
innovations into legal monopolies.  [43,10] 
13. D Market failures tend to occur from two 
different causes. Those causes include 
externalities, which can be positive or 
negative, and public goods.  [49,9] 
14. E Externalities can best be resolved through 
the creation of additional markets or 
government regulation, for example taxing 
the tobacco market to reflect the effects of 
secondhand smoke.   [51,8] 
15. E Entrepreneurs try to differentiate their 
products in order to establish temporary 
monopolies. One method is to invent around 
existing barriers to entry, like satellite 
television competing with cable 
television.   [49,4]

PROPERTY RIGHTS, PP. 56-57 
 
1. D Common resources, like the environment and 
streets, have low levels of excludability and 
high levels of rivalry, i.e. one person’s 
consumption is affected by another person’s. 
One person driving on the street would 
reduce the availability of road surfaces for 
other drivers..  [56,5] 
2. B Since nobody owns common resources, it is 
difficult to control who can use them. As a 
result, they are often over-utilized.  [56,5] 
3. D A good is considered high in rivalry if one 
person’s consumption of it reduces the 
availability to others. Radio is low rivalry 
because many people can listen without 
impacting others.  [56,2] 
4. D The simplest solution to externalities is to 
establish property rights. Taxes and other 
regulations can also perform this 
function.  [56,5] 
5. B Public goods, like national defense and radio 
broadcasts, have low levels of excludability. 
Given the low excludability, individuals can 
freely consume the good. Private goods are 
highly excludable.   [56, Figure 29] 
6. B If villagers made decisions collectively, they 
could internalize externalities. 
Independently, they tend not to account for 
the effects of their decisions on others.  [57,1] 
7. D Public goods, like national defense and radio 
broadcasts, have low levels of excludability 
and rivalry. Consumption is not restricted: 
one person’s consumption does not affect 
another person’s.  [56, Figure 29] 
8. E Private goods, such as haircuts and pizza, 
have a high degree of rivalry and a high 
degree of excludability.  [56,4] 
9. C The tragedy of the commons is associated 
with common goods, which have high rivalry 
but low excludability. Given the low 
excludability, individuals can freely consume 
the good. They are incentivized to consume 
as much as possible, to the detriment of 
overall well-being.    [56,5] 
10. E Since nobody owns common resources, it is 
difficult to control who can use them. As a 
result, they are often over-utilized.  [56,5] 
11. C Collective goods, like websites and radio 
broadcasts, have high levels of excludability 
and low levels of rivalry in consumption. 
Consumption is restricted and one person’s 
consumption does not affect another 
person’s.  [56,7] 
12. B Natural monopolies can profit from 
supplying non-rival collective goods since 
their MC is near-zero. However, monopolies 
often supply too few goods. Governments 
may intervene to distribute collective goods 
more efficiently.  [56,8] 
13. E Externalities arise when unowned rival 
goods are consumed by one party in such a 
way that another party is also affected. Since 
nobody owns common resources, one party 
can benefit or be harmed by another party’s 
use of the good.  [56,6] 
14. E The Coase Theorem explains that 
externalities can be resolved if the involved 
parties negotiate with each other. Other 
methods, like taxes, can help remedy 
externalities, but they are not covered in the 
Coase Theorem.  [51,3] 
15. E While individuals are always able to resolve 
externalities if they can negotiate freely, the 
costs of negotiation are often too high for an 
efficient solution to arise. For example, many 
homeowners would rather put up with noisy 
neighbors than negotiate with an unfriendly 
neighbor. The Coase Theorem thus cannot be 
used to explain how the externality can be 
internalized here.  [51,6]

formal and informal components (for 
example, bureaucratic culture) and have 
great diversity in stability, self-regulation, 
and size.  [58,1] 
2. C Rent-seeking behavior redistributes utility 
(benefit), rather than increasing total

question, but does not necessarily cause 
negative effects.  [59,0] 
3. B   [57,3] 
4. A Lobbying, regulatory capture, incoherent 
legislation, and budget surpluses contribute 
to the rise of pork barrel politics, but are not

5. A Questions about the nature of the 
government's role are ideological, and fall in 
the realm of normative economics. Answers 
to these questions differ on one’s definition of 
"social good".   [59,3] 
6. E The United States has import restrictions on 
sugar, limiting the supply of sugar from 
cheaper countries. Consequently, sugar 
prices remain twice that of the world's 
prices.   [59,0] 
7. E Governments tax citizens and residents to 
fund its other functions. Most tax systems 
are progressive, resulting in redistribution of 
wealth to some degree.  [57,5] 
8. C Governments enforce the rule of law in order 
to expand the scope of economic activity, and 
enable other social institutions to develop. 
Redistribution of wealth is a governmental 
function since it has the power of taxation; 
however, it does not have a mandate to keep 
markets in equilibrium.  [58,2] 
9. C Log rolling is defined as politicians 
exchanging votes for legislation (typically pet 
projects) in order to ensure sufficient support 
for both. “Pork barrel” is a phrase used to 
describe such legislation.   [58,7] 
10. E Rent seeking activities such as lobbying for a 
pet project all use resources in suboptimal 
ways, redistributing rather than increasing 
utility.  [59,1] 
11. A The American government uses price 
supports to maintain the domestic sugar 
industry. This policy involves a minimum 
price, or price floor.    [58,8]

enforcement of contractual obligations. 
Business ventures are protected under this 
ability. [58,2] 
13. E Pork barrel politics occur when an elected

assumes a standardized good with a large 
number of buyers and sellers and a market 
price that is widely known.  [59,8]

demand curve, states that there is a negative 
relationship between quantity demanded and 
price.  [59,9] 
4. A Key factors dictating the position of the 
demand curve for a good include consumer 
income, the price of related goods, consumer 
tastes, consumer expectations, and the

dollars.  [63, Figure 31] 
7. E Output per worker in the United States fell 
dramatically during the mid-1940s as World 
War Two came to an end and soldiers 
returning home from abroad entered the 
workforce.  [63, Figure 31] 
8. C While South Korea’s Gross Domestic Product 
was smaller than that of China, India, and 
Mexico in 2007, its Gross Domestic Product 
per capita was larger due to its 
comparatively small population.  [64, Figure 32] 
9. A In absolute terms, China’s absolute output in 
2007 was much larger than that of India, 
Mexico, Russia, and South Korea.  [64, Figure 32] 
10. D The alternation between periods of expansion 
and recession in an economy is known as the 
business cycle.  [64,3] 
11. A In 2007, the longest life expectancy at birth 
of any country was 82.3 years in Japan. 
Developing countries with low income per 
capita have lower life expectancies.   [65, Figure 
33] 
12. D Unemployment is defined as not having 
worked in the last week, but having sought 
work in the last four weeks.   [64,4] 
13. A Some people are always searching for work 
in a free market economy; the unemployment 
rate is therefore never zero.  [65,1] 
14. B As it results in widespread price increases, 
inflation leads to decreases in purchasing 
power since the value of fiat money remains 
constant.   [65,2] 
15. E A country that exports more than it imports 
is said to be running a trade surplus, while a 
country that imports more than it exports is 
said to be running a trade deficit.  [66,2]

MEASUREMENT: TOTAL OUTPUT AND REAL GDP, PP. 70-75 
 
1. C The United States Department of Commerce 
ordered Kuznets to develop a system to 
measure output in 1932. Kuznets received a 
Nobel Prize in 1971 for his work.  [70,4] 
2. D Economists include capital goods under GDP 
to account for countries investing in 
machines, factories, etc. They counted 
towards a country’s GDP only in the year 
they were produced.  [70,0] 
3. D A consumer durable refers to a good that 
lasts for a longer period of time. Any car or 
vehicle would satisfy this definition.  [71,1] 
4. B When producing cars, steel is an 
intermediate good. This means that it must 
not be included in Gross Domestic 
Product.  [68,1] 
5. A The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the 
Consumer Price Index on a monthly 
basis.  [72,7] 
6. C The government adjusts Social Security 
payments based on the cost of living as 
conveyed through the Consumer Price 
Index.  [73,3] 
7. B Gross Domestic Product calculations include 
consumption, investment, government 
purchases, and net exports, or GDP = C + I + 
G + NX.  [71,6] 
8. D Economists use a base year’s prices to 
calculate Gross Domestic Product. Doing so 
allows them to observe changes in production 
only.   [72,5] 
9. E The term “investment” in economics refers to 
the purchase of capital. Financial assets such 
as stocks and bonds are not designated as 
investment by economists.  [71,3] 
10. C A net export is defined as the amount of 
imports subtracted from the amount of 
exports. If a country imported more, then net 
exports would mathematically be 
lowered.  [71,5] 
11. B Government transfer payments are not 
included in Gross Domestic Product. 
However, the wages paid to government 
employees do qualify as government 
purchases.  [71,4] 
12. D Paying for a new house or apartment falls 
under residential fixed investment since it 
involves a place where a person lives.  [71,2] 
13. A Economists define nominal Gross Domestic 
Product as the Gross Domestic Product 
calculated based on current year prices. Real 
Gross Domestic Product provides a better 
indicator of production year-on-year.  [72,6] 
14. A The Consumer Price Index is an index 
number, and it is calculated relative to the 
cost of a bundle of goods in a base year.  [72,8] 
15. C Gross Domestic Product is a value that 
economists use to measure the total value of 
all goods and services produced in a 
country.  [70,5]

MEASURING INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT, PP. 73-77 
 
1. D Goods are not generally added to the CPI 
until they achieve a large market 
penetration.  [74,2] 
2. D The GDP deflator is a number used by 
economists to express the relation between 
the real GDP and nominal GDP. Multiplying 
real GDP by the deflator produces the 
nominal GDP.   [74,4] 
3. B Structural unemployment results from the 
skill mismatch between job openings and job-
seekers.   [75,3] 
4. A The quantities of each good in a bundle has 
the most impact on the CPI in a given year. 
For example, price fluctuations of a good 
which is purchased 100 times will have an 
impact 100 times greater than a good 
purchased only one time.   [73,2] 
5. B The adjustment of social Security benefits to 
reflect changes in the CPI is known as a cost-
of-living adjustment. Such adjustments are 
also commonly made to wages in response to 
higher living costs.  [73,3] 
6. B Frictional unemployment refers to the 
unemployment caused by the necessary 
process of matching employees to employers. 
It is always present and is part of the natural 
rate of unemployment.  [76,2] 
7. C Substitution bias refers to the tendency of 
consumers to purchase less of a more 
expensive good, and to find a cheaper 
alternative.  [73,5] 
8. E After the age of 16, everyone is considered of 
working-age. To be out of the labor force at 
that age, one must have not worked in the 
past week and have not actively sought work 
in the past month. The retired are out of the 
labor force.  [75,3] 
9. C The CPI overstates the rate of inflation due 
to substation bias, unmeasured quality 
changes, and the introduction of new goods 
and services. In 1996, the Boskin 
Commission estimated that the CPI 
overstated inflation by 1.3% a year.  [74,3] 
10. D The difference between the working-age 
population and the labor force are the 
unemployed people not looking for work. The 
labor force participation rate is the ratio of 
the labor force to the working-age 
population.   [75,5] 
11. D The GDP deflator only accounts for changes 
to domestically produced goods, while the 
CPI includes imported goods.  [74,7] 
12. D Cyclical unemployment refers to 
unemployment caused by recessions and 
depressions. The natural rate of employment 
refers to the typical rate of unemployment at 
full output.   [77,1] 
13. E The labor force consists only of those working 
age people who are either working or looking 
for a job. People who have not looked for a 
period of four weeks or longer are considered 
out of the labor force.  [74,10] 
14. E Cyclical unemployment results from poor 
performance of the economy, including 
recessions and depressions. Events like 
recessions mean unemployed persons have 
fewer options, resulting in discouragement 
and longer unemployment periods.  [77,1] 
15. B The labor force participation rate is defined 
as the fraction of the working-age population 
that is part of the labor force. In the United 
States, the rate is close to 61%.  [75,5]

GROWTH, PRODUCTIVITY, AND LIVING STANDARDS, PP. 77-80 
 
1. E GDP per capita only measures the real GDP 
divided by the amount of individuals in the 
country. It does not accurately reflect a 
change in the standard of living.  [79,1] 
2. E United States GDP increased nine-fold 
between 1900 and 2019, which directly 
reflects an increased value of goods and 
services produced in the country.   [77,2] 
3. C Real GDP per capita increased by a factor of 
9 between 1900 and 2019 in the US. 
However, this increase fails to include the 
notable changes in the standard of living 
that have occurred as well.  [77,2] 
4. C Physical capital serves as a catalyst for 
making other goods. Producing physical 
capital is an investment, as it can improve 
the rate of future production.  [80,2] 
5. E Households provide factors of production – 
land, labor, and capital – to firms to create 
goods and services.  [77,7] 
6. A The circular flow model shows that the 
government obtains income from households 
as taxes. The government also borrows from 
financial markets.  [78,1] 
7. B Technological advancement has always 
improved productivity the most. The 
invention of the engine, for example, has 
allowed businesses to accelerate the transfer 
of goods.  [80,5] 
8. D A firm is an organization that receives 
money in exchange for goods and 
services.   [77,9] 
9. B Labor productivity depends on technological 
information, human and physical capital, 
natural resources, and the politico-legal 
environment. Input prices are a determinant 
of supply that affects how much is rather 
than can be produced.  [80,2-6] 
10. A Owning natural resources can significantly 
improve a country’s wealth. However, a 
country can import natural resources and 
still thrive economically, like Singapore  [80,4] 
11. D While improving physical and human capital 
would result in more production in the long 
run, short-run needs must be fulfilled. It is 
possible to invest too much money, especially 
since there are diminishing returns on such 
investments.  [80,8] 
12. B Actors responsible for supplying goods and 
services are called firms. They combine 
various inputs that can be classed as fixed or 
variable.  [77,9] 
13. C Human capital is the intangible experience 
gained through education or training that 
makes workers better at their jobs. On-the-
job training is the quintessential example of 
human capital.  [80,3] 
14. E Goods and services are associated with 
spending and revenue in the circular flow 
model. Households spend their income on 
these goods which is transferred to firms as 
revenue.  [78, Figure 42]

SAVINGS, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, PP. 81-82 
 
1. B The NYSE stands for the New York Stock 
Exchange, the largest stock exchange in the 
world. Trillions of dollars are traded daily on 
the NYSE.  [82,1] 
2. A Financial institutions match investments 
with savings. This process allows an 
economy’s savings to go straight to its 
borrowers.  [82,3] 
3. A Banks make loans to borrowers. The initial 
amount borrowed is known as the principal, 
which accumulates interest over the tenure 
of the loan.   [81,6] 
4. D Financial intermediaries act as a go-between. 
They link borrowers and lenders to facilitate 
the investment process. Banks and mutual 
funds are major examples.   [82,3] 
5. E Investment in economic terms does not 
include (somewhat counterintuitively) stock 
exchange transactions, since the trade of 
shares does not result in the company 
receiving money to invest.  [82,2] 
6. D The savings and investment market 
functions to match consumers and suppliers 
just as in any other market. In this specific 
case, it leads to capital formation via the 
consequent investment.   [81,1] 
7. C Shareholders face more risk than 
bondholders do. Should a company fail, 
bondholders immediately gain some 
reimbursement, whereas shareholders lose 
much value.  [82,0] 
8. B Small companies are generally reliant on 
bank loans for investment funds, rather than 
the financial markets where bonds and 
shares can be issued.   [82,4] 
9. A Mutual funds are a popular investment 
option for individual investors with a smaller 
risk appetite. The funds hold primarily a mix 
of stocks and bonds.   [82,8] 
10. E Bond interest rates depend on two primary 
factors, the time horizon or tenure of the 
bond, and the risk that the issuer will 
default.   [81,6] 
11. C Mutual funds are a popular investment 
option for individual investors with a smaller 
risk appetite because of their diversified 
holdings, reducing the risk level.  [82,5] 
12. D A bond essentially is a proof of debt and 
promise of repayment. For example, someone 
who purchases a 1Y Treasury bond for 
$99.50 will receive $100 in one year’s 
time.  [81,5] 
13. E Companies issue dividends to purchasers of 
stock shares. These dividends are 
distributions of the firm’s profit.   [82,0] 
14. B The sale of a stock is referred to as equity 
finance. The sale of a bond is debt 
finance.  [81,8]

AGGREGATE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT, PP. 83-87 
 
1. E The higher the interest rate, the more people 
save. Lending their money yields greater 
rewards than spending it on immediate 
consumption.  [85,1] 
2. A A closed economy does not engage in trade 
with outside nations. There are neither 
exports nor imports.  [83,1] 
3. D The identity “expenditures = income = 
production” reflects how GDP is measured in 
such a way that these three values must be 
equal.  [83,1] 
4. C The government’s net fiscal position is given 
by T – G, or taxes less government 
spending.  A surplus occurs if T is larger 
than G, and a deficit if vice versa.   [83,5] 
5. A In a closed economy, saving equals 
investment. However, in an open economy, 
net capital outflows must be added to 
investment to equal the total level of 
savings.  [84,7] 
6. A Capital outflow of a country increases when a 
country’s resident purchases foreign assets. 
Outflow decreases if a foreign company 
purchases a domestic asset.    [83,8] 
7. A The aggregate demand curve includes all 
components of GDP, where Y = C + I + G + 
NX. Tax expenditures are offset by an equal 
decrease in household income.   [83,1] 
8. B Net exports and net capital outflows are 
equal. This relationship is the same as that 
of savings and investments.  [84,1] 
9. B A foreign portfolio investment occurs when 
stocks or bonds from another country are 
bought by a resident.  [83,10] 
10. B The price of goods varies based on the year. 
To find the real interest rate, subtract the 
rate of inflation from the nominal interest 
rate.   [84,13] 
11. C If the expected returns are greater than the 
interest rate, investors will act in self-
interest and make a loan in order to gain a 
net profit.  [85,2] 
12. A Crowding out occurs when, as a result of 
government borrowing, the interest rate 
increases, and investments are reduced.  [87,1] 
13. A Y – C – G = S = I + NX is a rearrangement of 
the standard equation for GDP in an open 
economy, Y = C + I + G + S + NX.  [84,6] 
14. B When supply decreases in a market, the net 
outcome is reduced quantity and higher 
interest rates, i.e. the level of investment 
falls.   [85,1] 
15. E The demand curve for savings reflects the 
level of investment demand. Investment 
increases when there is a change in 
productivity that allows borrowers to make 
better use of funds spent on capital.  [86, Figure

MONEY AND PRICES PP. 87-89 
 
1. B The quantity of money in an economy affects 
inflation. Having more goods in an economy 
would increase real GDP; printing money 
without the goods to back it up results in 
inflation.   [87,4] 
2. A Wealth refers to the different stores of value 
in an economy; it need not be restricted to 
purely monetary assets.   [87,9] 
3. A Cash is the most convenient medium of 
exchange and is used in many small 
transactions (though to differing degrees 
across the world).  [89,8] 
4. B Currency can be used to measure value 
because it has a unit of account. This allows 
people to measure something’s worth in 
terms of the currency.  [87,7] 
5. B Store of value is an item’s ability to retain 
buying power over time. Non-perishable 
goods with a stable demand are the best 
stores of value.   [87,8] 
6. C Liquidity refers the ease with which 
something can be converted to a medium of 
exchange.   [88,0] 
7. A Fiat money derives its value from an order or 
decree. Its value is subject to change: the 
currency does not have intrinsic value.  [88,1] 
8. C Fiat money derives its value from an order or 
decree, i.e. the government declaring it has 
value. Its value is subject to change as it 
lacks intrinsic value.  [88,1] 
9. C Commodity money is money that holds 
intrinsic value. During World War II, 
prisoners used to exchange cigarettes as a 
form of commodity money.  [88,1] 
10. C M1 consists of the most liquid assets, such as 
demand deposits. Savings deposits are not as 
liquid as the other goods in M1.  [88, Figure 46] 
11. B Credit cards are not part of the stock of 
money because they do not hold value; 
rather, they function to delay payments.  [88,4] 
12. E An asset is considered money if it is highly 
liquid. While a house is a major part of many 
families’ assets, it is too illiquid to function 
as money.   [88,0] 
13. C M1 consists of the most liquid assets. 
Savings deposits are part of M2, as they are 
not as liquid as the other goods in M1.  [88,

14. E A dollar bill has no intrinsic value; it cannot 
be used if the government issuing it has no 
power and is thus flat money. Rare minerals 
have intrinsic value.  [88,1]

CENTRAL BANKING AND THE MONEY SUPPLY, PP. 89-91 
 
1. D The amount of money supplied by the Fed, 
M, minus the amount of money held in 
currency by the public, C, results in the total 
reserves that are left in the banking 
sector.  [90,7] 
2. D The discount rate is the interest rate the 
Federal Reserve charges on loans made to 
smaller banks. It is one of the tools available 
in monetary policy.  [91,3] 
3. C The Federal Reserve very rarely changes the 
reserve ratio. Doing so can cause disruptions 
in the banking industry.  [91,1] 
4. E The Federal Open Market Committee meets 
every six weeks to discuss changes in 
monetary policy. It uses open market 
operations to adjust the interest rate.    [89,5] 
5. B The Federal Reserve can control money 
supply through open market operations. 
When trying to increase the money supply, 
the Fed buys bonds, injecting money into 
circulation.  [89,5] 
6. E To control the money supply in the country, 
the Federal Reserve engages in open market 
operations, during which it issues or buys 
back bonds to control the amount of money in 
the hands of private citizens.  [89,5] 
7. E Banks can create money, and therefore 
increase the liquidity of the economy. 
However, banks can create only money and 
not wealth.  [91,4] 
8. C The money multiplier equals the reciprocal of 
the reserve ratio. It represents the amount of 
money the banking sector creates from its 
reserves.  [90,5] 
9. C The monetary base refers to the money stock, 
which is proportional to the amount of 
currency that consumers have to spend. New 
currency can be issued without the reserve 
ratio changing.   [90,7] 
10. A High-powered money, also known as the 
monetary base, is defined as the combination 
of currency and reserves.  [90,7] 
11. E The discount rate is the interest rate the 
Federal Reserve System places on loans 
made to other banks. The discount rate is 
also closely linked to the federal funds rate, 
so increasing the discount rate discourages 
borrowing.    [91,2] 
12. E While fractional reserve banking can 
increase the money supply and thus 
investment, it leads to a lack of liquidity. 
This can prove costly during bank runs.  [91,3] 
13. A The Federal Reserve System does not 
directly control the federal funds rate, which 
is the rate banks charge another bank when 
borrowing reserves. Although the Fed 
controls the discount rate, which is closely 
linked to the federal funds rate, the Fed does 
not directly control the discount rate.  [91,2] 
14. B The money multiplier represents the total

LONG-RUN MONEY AND INFLATION, PP. 90-95 
 
1. B MV = PY refers to (money stock)(velocity of 
money) = (price level)(real GDP). M 
represents the money stock.    [94,6] 
2. C Through fractional reserves, a bank can, in 
effect, raise the amount of money in an 
economy. However, they also raise the 
amount of liabilities—money owed—so there 
is no real change in wealth through this 
process.  [90,1] 
3. D The money market includes the interactions 
between the supply of and demand for 
money. The supply curve of money is 
perfectly inelastic since it is fixed by the 
Federal Reserve. The demand for money can 
be influenced by the price level or public 
preferences.   [92,5] 
4. A In the short run, a sudden increase in the 
money supply will spur higher consumption, 
as people can temporarily use the larger 
amount of money to buy more goods at the 
same price.  [94,2] 
5. E MV = PY refers to (money stock)(velocity of 
money) = (price level)(real GDP). It is known 
as the equation of exchange.   [94,6] 
6. B VM = PY (velocity of money times the 
quantity of money will be equal to nominal 
GDP). Nominal GDP measures the nominal 
values of goods and services in the overall 
economy; this indirectly measures the 
volume and quantity of interactions in the 
economy.  [94,6] 
7. B Not all macroeconomic indicators can be 
altered in the short run. Velocity of money 
and real output are examples of short-term 
fixed indices; the quantity of money and the 
reserve ratio are changeable values.    [94,8] 
8. E If P is the price level, 1/P is equal to the 
value of a dollar in terms of the goods and 
services it can purchase. This can also be 
thought of as the purchasing power of a 
dollar.  [92,3] 
9. C VM = PY (velocity of money times the 
quantity of money will be equal to nominal 
GDP). Nominal GDP measures the nominal 
values of goods and services in the overall 
economy; this indirectly measures the 
volume and quantity of interactions in the 
economy.  [94,6] 
10. D ATMs allow people to carry around less 
money as it becomes more accessible. This 
reduces the overall demand for money.  [95,1] 
11. D People want to hold physical currency 
because it is a liquid medium of exchange, 
easy to use for purchases. With a greater use 
of credit cards, ATMs, and direct bank 
transfers, people hold less currency.  [95,1] 
12. B The money supply curve is represented by a 
vertical line as the money supply is fixed by 
the Federal Reserve.  [92,7] 
13. E Inflation represents a tax on people who hold 
money. The value of that money decreases 
and thus lowers their purchasing power.  [95,1] 
14. C During the 1970s, inflation rose into the 
double digits. Many consumers believed it to 
be the biggest problem facing the United 
States.  [94,10] 
15. C Given the neutrality of money, changes in 
aggregate price level should not matter 
because they do not affect real quantities. 
Even if the money supply were to double, the 
real value of goods would not change in the 
long run, as price levels would simply

3. B While cyclical unemployment is caused by a 
recession, frictional and structural 
unemployment are not.  [99,1] 
4. D Economists typically define a recession as 
two successive quarters of reduced levels of 
real GDP.  [96,2] 
5. D On a Keynesian model, price level depends 
on the intersection of AD and SRAS. This 
intersection indicates the willingness of 
consumers to purchase and firms to supply 
them for a certain price.  [103,1] 
6. C Output gap is the difference between 
potential output and actual output. If it is 
zero, then all resources are being fully 
employed, and so cyclical unemployment is 
zero.  [104,2] 
7. A The Keynesian model typically plots price 
level on the Y-axis and real Gross Domestic 
Product on the X-axis.  [101,11] 
8. E Because firms tend not adjust their prices on 
a daily basis, short-term output is driven 
primarily by aggregate demand, rather than 
potential output.  [101,2] 
9. D The quantity of goods and services that the 
economy can produce when using its 
resources at normal rates is known as the 
potential output of the economy. The 
difference between this value and the 
economy’s gross domestic product is known 
as the output gap.  [98,2] 
10. D The American economy shifted from a 
manufacturing to service industry in the 
1980s as other parts of the world 
industrialized and out-competed American 
manufacturing.   [99,2] 
11. D While cyclical unemployment is caused by a 
recession, frictional and structural 
unemployment are not. Hence, taken in 
combination, they form the natural rate of 
unemployment.  [99,1] 
12. B The growth rate of the population, 
availability of capital stock, and pace of 
technological advances all contribute to 
changes in the rate of growth of potential 
output. Inflation is a determinant of the 
value of money, not real values.   [100,1] 
13. A While firms respond to changes in demand 
by adjusting their prices in the long run, they 
respond in the short run by adjusting 
quantitates.  [101,7]

AGGREGATE DEMAND AND SUPPLY, PP. 101-104 
 
1. D The foreign exchange effect is related to the 
value of world currencies. At a lower price 
level, domestic goods are cheaper, and thus 
aggregate demand shifts up.  [102,4] 
2. A Government austerity measures will reduce 
overall government spending. This shifts 
aggregate demand left.  [102,7] 
3. E At a higher aggregate price level, domestic 
goods are expensive relative to foreign goods, 
so domestic consumers will demand imported 
goods instead.  [102,4] 
4. C Short-run aggregate supply is equal to real 
GDP at the expected aggregate price level. 
Expected price level and short-run aggregate 
supply are positively correlated. Changes in 
expected price cause shifts in the short-run 
aggregate supply curve.  [101,11] 
5. C If consumers wish to hold less money, they 
will choose to purchase illiquid assets. This 
increase in savings will shift AD 
rightwards.  [102,3] 
6. A If the expected price level increases, SRAS 
will shift upwards to mirror the rise. At the 
expected price level, SRAS will equal 
potential output.  [103,2] 
7. A Elon Musk’s SpaceX company is investing in 
a network of satellites that will increase 
internet access worldwide. This drastic 
increase in investment shifted the AD curve 
right, increasing aggregate demand at every 
price level. [102,5] 
8. D Shifts in LRAS are driven by investments in 
capital and technological innovation. This 
allows for increased potential output.  [104,1] 
9. E Since aggregate demand involves all goods in 
an economy, substituting one good for 
another has no effect on aggregate 
demand  [102,2-4] 
10. E Aggregate price levels of an economy will 
increase if the money supply grows faster 
than potential output.  [107,2] 
11. E The aggregate demand curve has a negative 
slope, but for different reasons than the 
demand curve in microeconomics. It depends 
on wealth, interest rates, and foreign 
exchange effects.  [102,3] 
12. E Wealth effects describes the phenomenon in 
which a decline in aggregate price increases 
consumer purchasing power and aggregate 
demand.  [102,2] 
13. E Increased savings will decrease interest 
rates. These decreased rates will eventually 
prompt further investment and shift AD 
rightwards.  [102,3] 
14. E Recessions occur when output is below 
potential output. This most often occurs with 
a leftward shift in AD.  [104,3] 
15. C Firms are often unable to adjust quickly to 
shifts in prices. In the long run, they will be 
able to more effectively do so.  [103,0]

KEYNESIAN MODEL AND MONETARY POLICY, PP. 103-109 
 
1. C The Federal Reserve controls the interest 
rate by regulating the money supply. The 
amount of money in the economy controls the 
interest rate, which in turn regulates 
spending and investment.   [108,7] 
2. C Output gap is the difference between 
potential output and actual output. If it is 
zero, then all resources are being fully 
employed, and so any type of unemployment 
would also be zero.  [104,2] 
3. B If the economy is in a period of recession and 
more money is introduced, interest rates will 
fall. Consumption and investment spending 
will be stimulated. The Federal Reserve often 
modulates the money supply to regulate 
these forces.   [108,7] 
4. E If prices all immediately adjusted to changes 
in AD, then short-run fluctuations would 
never occur and Y = Y*. However, firms can 
only adjust quantities in the short-term; 
short-run fluctuations occur until firms are 
able to adjust prices.  [104,8] 
5. A In the long run, increases in the money 
supply yield an increase in prices, but no 
change in overall economic activity.  [108,1] 
6. C Monetary and fiscal policy can help fix a 
recessionary or expansionary gap. 
Sometimes, though, these policies can 
overcorrect a gap, resulting in 
inflation.  [108,4] 
7. B Fiscal policy involves changing government 
spending and taxes to fix recessions and 
expansions. Monetary policy serves the same 
purpose, but does so through open market 
operations, changing the discount rate, and 
manipulating banks’ reserve 
requirements.  [108,5] 
8. D Expansionary fiscal policy is designed to 
increase government spending in an attempt 
to either curtail or end an economic 
recession.  [108,4] 
9. B It takes Congress six months to one year to 
respond to economic issues with additional 
spending, meaning that the economy might 
already be in recovery by the time that the 
money hits the market. [109,2] 
10. B Y* corresponds to potential output in the 
long-run. If a nation’s output exceeds 
potential output, it is producing more than it 
can sustain and is in a period of expansion. 
Expansions involve economic growth.  [104,8] 
11. B The economy adjusts to shocks in aggregate 
supply by shifting the price level until SRAS 
intersects AD at the new price level and 
potential output.  [104,8] 
12. C If Y*>Y, the economy is in a recession. As a 
result, the Fed will increase money supply to 
try and shift AD rightwards.  [108,7] 
13. E If Y>Y*, the economy is in an expansion. 
Expansions create inflationary gaps which 
raise prices.  [104,8] 
14. D Estimating GDP can often take close to 3 
months. Such delays in information can 
make government response very 
difficult.  [109,1] 
15. B In the Keynesian model of short-run 
fluctuations, AD and SRAS meet where Y = 
Y*. This equilibrium point has all resources 
fully utilized to maximize efficiency and 
production.  [103, Figure 55]

LIFE IN THE PREINDUSTRIAL WORLD - DISEASE AND DISASTER,  
PP. 111-112 
 
1. E $1.90/day is the World Bank's international 
poverty line. Over two centuries, the 
percentage of world population living in 
extreme poverty has fallen from nearly 90% 
to around 10% as of 2017. [111,1,1] 
2. C Around 1500 CE, between one-half and 
three-quarters of those who worked did so on 
farms. Agriculture was the dominant sector 
of economies until the Industrial Revolution. 
[111,1,2] 
3. A About 34% of U.S. laborers in 1870 were in 
"blue-collar," non-agricultural work. This is 
within a percentage point of the one-third 
mark (33.3%). [111,1,2] 
4. B Animal fat, or tallow, was the primary 
material for candles before industrial-made 
wax candles became the standard. Tallow 
candles were cost-prohibitive for many pre-
industrial households. [111,1,3; 111,2,0] 
5. D Refrigeration as it is understood today was 
not available to pre-industrial societies. The 
first public demonstration of artificial 
refrigeration was by William Cullen in 1756. 
[111,2,1] 
6. C The nominal cost of $50 would be well over 
$1,000 in today's money. Only around 2% of 
the white adult population at the time could 
afford a clock. [111,2,2] 
7. A The Great Fire of London burned for several 
days in early September of 1666. Samuel 
Pepys recorded his thoughts on the fire in 
some of his famous diary's most memorable 
and harrowing passages. [112,1,caption] 
8. D Because travel was difficult and expensive in 
pre-industrial Europe, most individuals 
married others who grew up nearby. 
Marriages between second and even first 
cousins were relatively common. [112,1,1] 
9. E Due to the limitations of preindustrial travel, 
many companies and individual 
craftspersons had no choice but to get raw 
materials nearby and sell in the area. "Buy 
local" was more than a slogan; it was reality. 
[112,1,1] 
10. E In 1800, only an estimated 12% of people on 
Earth were literate. This went hand in hand 
with the dearth of schooling available to most 
people. [112,1,2] 
11. E The Black Plague, also known as the Black 
Death and other metal band name 
inspirations, was a pandemic of bubonic 
plague during the mid-1300s. Estimates of 
Europeans killed range from 30% to 60% of 
the population. [112,1,3] 
12. B Roughly one-quarter of children in the 
preindustrial world died before their first 
birthday. In other words, 3 in 4 survived that 
long. [112,1,3] 
13. C Drought, floods, pests, frost, and blight were 
all common causes of famine. Earthquakes, 
while devastating, would not cause long 
famines by themselves.  [112,2,1] 
14. E Crowded cities using mostly wood 
construction were susceptible to major fires. 
Examples include London in 1666, Boston in 
1760, and San Francisco in 1906. [112,2,2]

DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS - MECHANIZATION (PP. 112-114) 
 
1. C Deirdre McCloskey's economic work critiques 
a perceived overemphasis on mathematics in 
economics. She coined the term "The Great 
Enrichment" for the stark rise in living 
standards from the 19th century on. [112,2,4] 
2. E Between 1000 and 1600 CE, GDP per capita 
in the United Kingdom was effectively 
stagnant. It rose gradually between 1600 and 
1800 before rising exponentially from 1800 
on. [113,1,fig.59] 
3. C GDP per capita in the United States had a 
gradual but distinct rise between the start of 
British colonization and 1800. Around 1800, 
exponential growth began. [113,1,fig.59] 
4. E Roser (2013b) found that GDP per capita in 
the United States rose over 21 times between 
1800 and 2018. Other industrialized nations 
showed similar growth in the 20-30 times 
range. [112,2,5] 
5. A In 1870, the average laborer in the United 
States worked 3,096 hours per year, nearly 
60 hours per week divided over 52 weeks. 
The average workweek in the United States 
has fallen considerably over the last 150 
years. [113,1,1] 
6. A Long-haul flights enable most point-to-point 
travel worldwide, even across oceans, to take 
place within 24 hours. This is, of course, 
assuming no flight delays. [113,1,2] 
7. A Pre-Great Enrichment, long-distance 
relationships required sending messages by 
courier or post. This evolved into telegrams, 
telephone calls, and Internet-enabled 
communication such as instant messages and 
video chat. [113,1,2] 
8. B World average life expectancy at birth has 
more than doubled, from under 30 years to 
over 70 years. Much of this is due to a steep 
fall in infant and child mortality. [113,2,1] 
9. B Medical advances have cut mortality from 
infectious disease by over 90% since the start 
of the Great Enrichment. They have not, 
however, completely eliminated pandemics, 
such as influenza in the 1910s and COVID in 
the 2020s. [113,2,1] 
10. E Pittsburgh was an industrial city that used 
coal mined nearby to power its factories, 
most famously its iron and steel works. This 
led to extensive pollution and low air quality.  
[113,2,2] 
11. C Over 1 million automobile fatalities are 
recorded each year worldwide. These deaths 
show how technology can harm at the same 
time it improves other lives. [113,2,2] 
12. D Carbon dioxide (CO2) contributes to the 
greenhouse effect, and so climate change. 
The threats of climate change, such as rising 
sea levels submerging land and property, 
pose a potentially multi-trillion-dollar 
economic problem to solve. [113,2,2] 
13. C The British Royal Navy's pulley block factory 
allowed ten workers to produce what had 
taken over one hundred workers to make by 
hand. This was a small but crucial step 
toward the United Kingdom becoming a 
naval power. [114,1,4] 
14. E In 1833, Obed Hussey patented a reaping 
machine that required only one person and 
two horses to operate. Hussey's reaper was a 
rival to that of Cyrus McCormick, patented 
the next year. [114,2,1] 
15. D The first thread-spinning machines could 
spin very fine thread more reliably than most 
human labor. This allowed better and less 
expensive production of high-quality textiles 
from this very fine thread. [114,2,2]

1. B Steel is an alloy of iron and a small amount 
of carbon. Other elements are sometimes 
present, such as chromium in stainless steel. 
[114,2,3] 
2. D Sir Henry Bessemer, as he was later known, 
was an English inventor and engineer. He is 
best known for the steel purification process 
bearing his name. [115,1,0] 
3. D The Bessemer process blasts air through 
molten steel. This lets the oxygen in the air 
oxidize impurities for easy removal. [115,1,0] 
4. A Crushed limestone, processed through 
kilning, is the main ingredient in cement. 
Cement allows the construction of today's 
vast infrastructure, such as massive dams 
that provide water for cities. [115,1,1] 
5. E Kilning, a burning process, turns calcium 
carbonate (CaCO3) into calcium oxide (CaO), 
a useful material, and carbon dioxide (CO2), 
a greenhouse gas. This makes cement 
manufacturing a significant contributor to 
climate change. [115,1,1] 
6. C Adding silicates to cement can have multiple 
effects, depending on the silicate. Silicate-
improved cement may be harder than regular 
cement, for example, or set underwater in a 
way regular cement does not allow. [115,1,1] 
7. A Portland cement, invented by Joseph Aspdin, 
was patented in 1824 and remains in use 
almost two centuries later. It was named for 
its resemblance to Portland stone, mined on 
the Isle of Portland in England. [115,2,0] 
8. C Whale bones, ivory, and tortoise shells were 
used for billiard balls, knife handles, combs, 
and electrical insulation, among other things. 
Stemware usually was made of crystal or 
glass, not animal products. [115,2,1] 
9. C The clothing materials most frequently 
replaced by plastic are expensive, such as 
natural leather and silk. "Nylons" as a term 
for stockings takes its name from nylon, a 
thermoplastic resembling the silk it replaced. 
[115,2,1] 
10. A A fallow field is one plowed but not sown 
with seeds, letting it rest for a planting cycle 
or longer. Leaving a field fallow is one 
strategy for replenishing nutrients in soil. 
[115,2,2] 
11. D Legumes, such as soybeans, peanuts, and 
clover, provide nitrogen fixation through 
symbiosis with special bacteria called 
rhizobia. The other choices are cereals that 
deplete nitrogen rather than fixing it. [115,2,2] 
12. B Manure and guano are both waste products 
from animals. Manure comes from cows and 
chickens among other domesticated animals, 
while guano comes from the waste of 
seabirds and, more rarely, bats. [115,2,2] 
13. D The Haber-Bosch process yields ammonia 
(NH3), a key fertilizer precursor. Life tip: 
never mix bleach and ammonia cleaning 
products. It produces toxic chloramine gas, 
which can be fatal if inhaled. [115,2,2] 
14. D About one-half of all food produced on Earth 
uses fertilizer produced through the Haber-
Bosch process. Fritz Haber received the 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 for the 
achievement; Carl Bosch received the same 
award in 1931 for a different breakthrough. 
[115,2,2] 
15. B Corn yields in the present-day United States 
are over 10 tons per hectare, compared to 
under 2 tons per hectare in 1940. Much of 
the increase is due to new hybrid varieties

ENERGY - COMMUNICATIONS (PP. 116-118) 
 
1. E Wind, water, and muscles (animal and 
human) were the main sources of mechanical 
energy before the Industrial Revolution. Oil 
as a source dates to the 1860s. [116,1,1] 
2. A Steam engines create mechanical energy 
from heat. This heat is created by burning 
fuel, such as wood or coal. [116,1,2; 116,2,0] 
3. B Thomas Newcomen's 1712 steam engine was 
the first practical device of its kind. James 
Watt later improved upon the design so 
much that Newcomen is now a neglected 
figure in engineering history. [116,2,0] 
4. A The first practical uses for steam engines 
were in mines, where they pumped out water 
from flooded zones. Steam engines soon 
spread to industry (factories) and transport 
(locomotives). [116,2,0] 
5. B The oil (in the sense of petroleum) industry 
emerged in the mid-19th century, with the 
1860s United States a hotbed of activity. 
This led to a decline in the whaling industry, 
for whom whale oil was a key product. [116,2,1] 
6. A Kerosene was the first refined oil product. 
James Young, of Scotland, and Abraham 
Gesner, of Canada, had rival claims for being 
the first to derive kerosene from petroleum. 
[116,1,1] 
7. A Thomas Edison first demonstrated his 
incandescent lamp, or electric light bulb, in 
1879. Electric lighting revolutionized how 
people lived and worked by removing the 
constraints of the day-night cycle. [117,1,1] 
8. D The electric power grid enabled transmission 
of energy across great distances through 
power lines. Once a local source of water 
power, Niagara Falls suddenly could supply 
power to more distant areas. [117,1,1] 
9. A Steam-powered railways originated in the 
United Kingdom. The first fully steam-
powered railway line, also the world's first 
intercity rail line, was the Liverpool and 
Manchester Railway, opened in 1830. [117,1,2] 
10. B It took some six months of hazardous travel 
to go between New York and San Francisco 
in the mid-1800s. The Transcontinental 
Railroad, opened in 1869, shrank this time to 
six days. [117,1,2] 
11. C The automobile enabled the daily commute, 
and thereby the suburbs. Suburbs promised 
both personal space and easy access to their 
neighboring cities. [117,1,3] 
12. D The Wright Brothers' airplane had its first 
controlled heavier-than-air flight in 1903. 
This led to the development of military 
aircraft and civilian air travel. [117,2,1]

a majority of seaborne shipping travels in 
standardized containers. [117,2,2] 
15. B Electromagnetism, once studied by scientists, 
enabled communications technologies relying 
on it. These range from the telegraph to 
telephones, television, and the Internet.

which outlived the telegraph. [118,1,0] 
17. C Radio as a commercial broadcasting business 
emerged in the United States in 1920. That 
year, KDKA in Pittsburgh became the first 
licensed radio station in the United States. 
[118,1,1] 
18. D Pre-Great Enrichment, the fastest way to 
send a message in text was to write or print 
it and then send it via horseback courier or 
sailing ship. Near-instantaneous 
communication did not emerge until the 
1800s. [117,2,3; 118,1,0] 
19. E Broadcasting allowed many listeners or 
viewers to hear the same message 
simultaneously across great distances. This 
simultaneous exposure to news and 
entertainment allowed mass culture to 
emerge. [118,1,1] 
20. E First developed by ARPA in the 1960s, the

contributors include Louis Pasteur and 
Robert Koch. [118,3] 
2. E Robert Koch is commonly nicknamed "the 
father of microbiology" for his 
groundbreaking research. Among other 
diseases, he identified the causes of cholera, 
anthrax, and tuberculosis. [118,3] 
3. B Water chlorination is a key line of defense 
against germs that cause waterborne 
diseases, such as typhoid. The strong smell of 
swimming pools is an extreme example of 
water chlorination. [118,4] 
4. A The Anopheles genus of mosquitoes is 
responsible for the spread of malaria. This is 
a common reason for the use of mosquito nets 
in tropical areas. [119,0] 
5. C While many diseases have been suppressed 
by vaccination, only two have been 
eradicated. The first was smallpox, which 
had its last naturally occurring case in 1977. 
[119,1] 
6. E Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection and so 
may respond to antibiotics (though drug 
resistance is a growing concern). The other 
choices are viral diseases, against which 
antibiotics do nothing. [119,2] 
7. E Since 1900, infectious disease mortality has 
fallen more than 90% in the United States. 
Vaccination and other eradication techniques 
have all but eliminated many former 
scourges as killers of Americans. [119,3] 
8. A The First Industrial Revolution began in the 
mid-1700s in Britain (the United Kingdom). 
The First Industrial Revolution was marked 
by largely mechanical innovation. [119,4] 
9. B The First Industrial Revolution's key 
innovations usually involved minimal 
scientific discovery and often were near-
purely mechanical in origin. The mechanical 
reaper is a good example of a First Industrial 
Revolution innovation. [119,4; 119,5] 
10. B Notable First Industrial Age inventions 
include the steam engine, the locomotive, 
textile machinery such as the spinning jenny, 
and horse-drawn agricultural machinery 
such as the mechanical reaper. The 
telegraph, based on the science of 
electromagnetism, belongs to the Second 
Industrial Age. [119,4; 119,5] 
11. D The Ford Model T was the first American 
automobile accessible to the country's middle 
class. It was produced between 1908 and 
1927. [119,image/caption] 
12. C The system of mass production characterized 
by the assembly line emerged during the 
Second Industrial Revolution. This system 
had a handful of antecedents, most notably 
the Venetian Arsenal in medieval and 
Renaissance Europe. [119,5] 
13. E During the Second Industrial Revolution, 
global industrial leadership shifted from the 
United Kingdom to the United States. This 
was especially true after the First and 
Second World Wars, which devastated much 
of Europe. [119,5]

ECONOMIC GROWTH - SOLOW AND TFP (PP. 119-122) 
 
1. E The economic definition of "technology" is a 
way of transforming a set of inputs into 
outputs. For example, the machinery that 
transforms silicon into microchips is a 
technology in the economic sense. [120,1] 
2. E A process innovation is a new, more efficient 
way to transform inputs into known outputs. 
Bessemer's steel-making technique is a 
notable example of a process innovation. 
[120,2] 
3. E A product innovation creates an entirely new 
output from inputs. The development of 
plastic is an example of a product innovation. 
[120,2] 
4. B Labor productivity is a measure of output 
divided by either individual labor units 
(workers) or individual labor units multiplies 
by time (worker-hours). [120,3] 
5. E Machines act as labor multipliers by 
enabling workers to produce much greater 
outputs than would be possible by hand. 
Injection molding of plastic, for instance, is 
far more efficient than trying to hand-mold 
plastic. [120,4] 
6. C Robert Solow, born in 1924, had his college 
studies interrupted by World War II service. 
He returned to the United States and did 
groundbreaking research in the 1950s, 
including the creation of the Solow-Swan 
model of economic growth. [120,7] 
7. A Y = AK1/3L2/3 is a production function, more 
specifically a Cobb-Douglas function. It 
models output as a product of three factors: 
capital, labor, and total factor productivity 
(TFP). [120,7; 120,8] 
8. B The K in the production function represents 
capital. In economics, "C" usually stands for 
"consumption" (as in GDP calculations), so K, 
the first letter of the German form "Kapital," 
substitutes here. [120,8; 121,1] 
9. C As used in the text, Y represents GDP, gross 
domestic product, or the output of an entire 
nation. In other uses, Y can generalize to any 
output, such as that of a factory. [120,8; 121,1] 
10. C TFP stands for Total Factor Productivity, 
appearing as the letter "A" in Solow's Y = 
AK1/3L2/3 function. The term and its acronym 
were coined after Solow's groundbreaking 
1950s papers. [121,1] 
11. D K (capital) has the exponent 1/3 (equivalent to 
a cube root). To double output, capital must 
increase by a factor of eight (81/3 = 2), or 
octuple. [121,fig.60] 
12. A With Y representing GDP and L representing 
the labor force, Y / L equals the output per 
worker, or GDP per capita for the labor force. 
(This excludes students, retirees, and the 
unemployed, among others.) [122,fig.61] 
13. C Solow's 1950s work found that capital had 
nearly no influence on raising GDP per 
capita in the United States. Instead, what 
was later termed TFP was the key factor in 
growth. [122,2] 
14. B Technological innovations have made 
microchips far more powerful since 1970 and 
thus more valuable. This in turn has sent 
labor productivity soaring on a per-worker 
basis. [120,5] 
15. E Robert Solow received the National Medal of 
Science in 1999. He had become a Nobel 
laureate twelve years earlier, in 1987.

CREATIVE DESTRUCTION - PAYING FOR PROGRESS (PP. 123-126) 
 
1. D Joseph Schumpeter first used the term 
"creative destruction" in a 1942 book. His 
ideas, though not the term itself, derive from 
the original writings of Karl Marx. [123,1] 
2. A Technological progress can harm firms whose 
products are rendered obsolete. Typewriters 
in the age of personal computers are one 
example; horse-drawn buggies after the 
automobile are another. [123,1] 
3. A Technological unemployment results from 
machines replacing workers by being better 
or less costly. Cashiers have already 
experienced technological unemployment 
from self-checkout lanes and self-scan 
payment schemes. [123,2] 
4. B Technology creates new jobs as well as 
destroying them. For example, as work 
making horse-drawn buggies fell, work 
making automobiles increased. [123,2; 123,3] 
5. B Specialized workers, those most vulnerable 
to technological unemployment, often do not 
have the skills needed to transfer seamlessly 
to the newly created jobs. They suffer, even 
as society as a whole benefits. [123,4] 
6. B Real GDP tries to make GDP figures 
comparable across years by removing the 
effect of inflation. Real GDP growth is true 
growth, not merely keeping up with inflation. 
[123,5] 
7. B Between the 1950s and 2020, average real 
GDP growth in the United States was around 
2% per year. True economic growth over time 
was a reality, despite short-term setbacks. 
[123,5; 124,0] 
8. A Technological innovation and various 
improvements to labor have improved real 
GDP for the United States since the 1950s. 
Inflation does not affect real GDP directly. 
[124,1] 
9. D Technology's share of contributing to GDP 
per capita growth in the United States from 
the 1950s to 2020 is about 1% per year. This 
is side by side with contributions from 
improved labor and capital. [124,2] 
10. B The ideas for machines and other inventions 
are non-rival, in that they can be shared 
without taking from someone. While two 
children must share in playing with a single 
toy car, the idea of a toy car can be used by 
any company in the world without taking 
from another company. [125,2; 126,0] 
11. C Around 27% of global R&D spending takes 
place in the United States. This is the 
highest in the world nominally, though not 
on a percentage-of-GDP basis. [124,5] 
12. E Private industry accounts for around 73% of 
R&D spending in the United States. The 
federal government (20%) accounts for most 
of the rest. [125,0] 
13. E China and Europe each account for around 
22% of global R&D spending as of 2019. This 
puts them in joint second behind the United 
States (27%) and ahead of Japan (7%). [124,5] 
14. E Government R&D spending in the United 
States as a percentage of the total peaked in 
1964. This was during the Space Race, a 
military and scientific rivalry with the Soviet 
Union that was part of the Cold War. [125,0] 
15. E The government share of R&D spending 
peaked at 67%. This is within one percentage 
point of two-thirds. [125,0]

APPROPRIATION - COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS (PP. 126-129) 
 
1. A Paul Romer's best-known work is on 
endogenous growth theory. It posits internal 
rather than external factors for economic 
growth. [126,2] 
2. A Investors and entrepreneurs generally go 
into business to make the most money 
possible. This profit maximization approach 
is a common lens through which economists 
view these individuals and firms. [126,2] 
3. B R&D is inherently risky; even if average 
returns are good, there is no guarantee that 
any one project will pay off. A mature firm, 
populated by layers of risk-averse 
management, may have less appetite for 
R&D risk. [126,3] 
4. A An excludable good is one that an individual 
or firm can prevent others from using. A 
prototype automobile that is not for sale is an 
example of an excludable good. [126,5] 
5. E Thomas Edison earned the nickname 
"Wizard of Menlo Park" for his inventions at 
the New Jersey site. Most famous among 
them is the incandescent lamp, better known 
today as the light bulb. [127,caption] 
6. B Appropriability is the degree to which a 
creator or investor can capture the social 
value of an innovation. Secrecy and lead time 
are two methods firms use to try to increase 
appropriability. [127,4] 
7. E Reverse engineering is figuring out how to 
make something (for example, a new 
invention) by studying the object: the 
materials used to make it, the way parts fit 
together, and so on. [127,5] 
8. B Jack Dorsey is a co-founder and former CEO 
of Twitter. He sent the first Tweet on Twitter 
on March 21, 2006. [128,caption] 
9. A About one-half of inventions are protected by 
secrecy, according to surveys of 
manufacturing firms, as published by Cohen, 
Nelson, and Walsh (2000). [128,0] 
10. B Lead time is the period the creator of an 
invention has between the invention's debut 
and the appearance of copycats. Creators can 
use lead time to recoup R&D costs or further 
improve the invention to differentiate it. [128,2; 
128,3] 
11. D Complementary assets allow a firm to 
leverage an innovation more effectively than 
rivals. In concrete manufacturing, for 
example, clay and volcanic ash are 
complementary assets because they improve 
the quality of concrete. [128,5] 
12. A Complementary assets are ways to allow a 
firm to leverage an innovation more 
effectively than rivals, such as a large sales 
force or a great reputation. Patents fall 
under intellectual property protection rather 
than complementary assets. [128,5] 
13. C Network effects are technologies that gain in 
value as more people use them. Facebook and 
other social media platforms rely heavily on 
network effects. [128,6; 129,0] 
14. C The apps available for a mobile operating 
system create convenience and utility for 
users, and thus value for the system. The 
App Store for iOS is one prominent 
contemporary example. [129,0] 
15. C Economies of scale allow average costs of 
making a good to fall toward the marginal 
cost as production increases. As a factory 
makes more microcircuits, for example, the 
average cost of making a single microcircuit 
falls as more are made, creating an economy 
of scale. [129,1]

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - NON-PROFIT SUPPORT (PP. 129-131) 
 
1. B Common forms of intellectual property 
include copyright, patents, and trademarks. 
Apple Inc.'s trademark for its world-famous 
apple logo is an example of intellectual 
property. [129,2] 
2. E As a novel, The Lathe of Heaven is eligible 
for copyright protection, which the author 
exercised during her lifetime. It will remain 
under copyright until nearly the end of the 
21st century. [129,2] 
3. E A utility patent, the commonest type of 
patent issued by the United States, is good 
for twenty years, or two decades. This is up 
from seventeen years before the mid-1990s. 
[129,2] 
4. B Intellectual property rights turn non-
excludable goods into the excludable variety. 
A patent, for instance, excludes others from 
manufacturing an invention legally. [129,2] 
5. C Patents must balance appropriability, the 
creator's ability to get value from an 
innovation, and the social value of that 
innovation reaching the wider world. The 
twenty-year patent period is the current 
attempt to strike that balance. [129,3] 
6. D A patent allows the holder to sell the rights 
to make an invention, either non-exclusively 
or by selling the patent itself. This lets a non-
entrepreneurial investor appropriate part of 
the value of an invention without the risk of 
setting up a business. [129,4; 130,0] 
7. E Per Mezzanotti and Simcoe (2022), larger 
manufacturing firms are more likely to use 
patents to protect their innovations than 
others. This makes the (very large) 
multinational conglomerate the best choice 
among the answers given. [130,1] 
8. C Patents reveal the secrets of an invention 
and come with upfront costs to secure them. 
Further, they require patent holders to find 
infringers, identify them enough to file a 
lawsuit, and then win at court, which is 
never a guarantee. [130,1] 
9. B David Wootton, a British history professor, 
ventured this argument in his 2015 book, 
The Invention of Science: A New History of 
the Scientific Revolution. [130,2] 
10. B Knowledge spillover is a positive externality 
(not negative) wherein one party's R&D has 
positive effects on another party. Knowledge 
spillover is a boon overall but highly difficult 
for the original party to appropriate. [130,3] 
11. E Nordhaus (2004) found that, on average, 
inventors are only able to appropriate 2.2% of 
the social value of their inventions. This 
meager return is one reason why many 
companies underinvest in R&D relative to 
the social optimum. [130,4; 131,0] 
12. B Because appropriability focuses on excluding 
others from gaining value from innovations, 
this contradicts the goals of non-profit 
organizations which are trying to produce the 
greatest social good. [131,1] 
13. E While only 27% of R&D in the United States 
is non-profit-funded, the sector accounts for 
two-thirds of scientific research. This is in 
part because basic scientific research is hard 
to appropriate value from for corporations. 
[131,3] 
14. D Scholarships for future scientists, creating 
and enforcing patent systems, and monetary 
support of private sector R&D are all 
promotional efforts. A levy, by contrast, is a 
tax on R&D, and would have the opposite 
effect. [131,5] 
15. B Firms may be reluctant to spend on R&D 
because knowledge spillovers lead others to 
benefit, rather than the firm that caused 
them. On the other hand, a rival firm's 
knowledge spillover can lower the original 
firm's projected R&D costs because the 
spillover did work for them already. [130,4]

SIZE OF MARKET - CULTURE AND INNOVATION, PP. 131-133 
 
1. E Boulton & Watt steam engines fueled 
everything from mining equipment to 
coinage machines in their heyday. Matthew 
Boulton, though a scientist in his own right, 
is best remembered today as the business 
side of his partnership with James Watt. 
[131,6] 
2. C Mitra and Mawson (2017) found that one in 
six people suffered infection by a tropical 
disease in 2017. These diseases, however, 
have enjoyed relatively little R&D spending. 
[132,0] 
3. D Because tropical diseases largely affect 
lower-income individuals in the Global 
South, there is little potential profit for 
private firms. This leads to low for-profit 
R&D investment in the field. [132,0] 
4. B Just four new medicines licensed between 
1975 and 1997 treated tropical diseases, per 
Glennerster, Kremer, and Williams (2005). 
This is an obvious mismatch with the social 
value of new treatments. [132,0] 
5. A The Gates Foundation helped fund a 2007 
initiative to subsidize vaccination against 
pneumococcus, a common and deadly 
bacterium. Kremer, Levin, and Snyder (2020) 
found this initiative highly effective. [132,1] 
6. E The federal government paid for many doses 
of COVID-19 vaccine and made them freely 
available at the height of the pandemic. 
These doses protected millions of Americans 
in the face of a new and life-threatening 
disease. [132,1] 
7. D Cities, or urban environments, are 
responsible for more invention and 
innovation than their population share would 
suggest. Several theories have arisen to 
explain this effect. [132,2] 
8. E Citations within a patent show where an 
invention has built upon previous ideas and 
work. This is a form of knowledge spillover. 
[132,3] 
9. A The agglomeration benefits of cities include 
higher wages, networking opportunities, and 
concentrations of talent and potential 
investors. Lower taxes, however, do not 
necessarily follow. [132,3; 133,0] 
10. D Planned or socialist economies, such as that 
of the Soviet Union in the 1960s, were hostile 
to markets or outright banned them. This cut 
off inventors' abilities to appropriate value 
that way. [133,1] 
11. A Enslaved persons were themselves treated as 
property and had extremely limited or 
nonexistent ability to own property 
themselves. Edmond's enslaver took 
Edmond's invention and spread knowledge of 
it, creating the modern vanilla industry 
while Edmond remained enslaved. [133,1] 
12. E Economic institutions are the "rules of the 
game" for economic activity in a society. This 
may include political, economic, and legal 
systems and their instruments, though not 
private entities such as manufacturing firms. 
[133,3] 
13. A Extractive institutions rig the rules of society 
to benefit the few in power at the expense of 
the many. An absolute monarch with total 
power in a country is an example of an 
extractive institution. [133,3] 
14. D In A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the 
Modern Economy, Joel Mokyr advanced his 
argument that the ideas of progress and 
growth were key to the Great Enrichment. 
These ideas had to be invented themselves, 
rather than being present in humanity all 
along. [133,5] 
15. A Because new inventions threaten established 
firms with creative destruction, those firms 
may attempt to fight back through ways 
other than capitalist competition. This could 
include expensive court battles to crush 
upstarts or lobbying lawmakers or regulators 
to literally ban the new creations. [133,2]
